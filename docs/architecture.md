# Court Coder Architecture

This document outlines the architecture of the Court Coder Basketball Playbook Animator web application.

## Overview

Court Coder is a client-side web application that enables basketball coaches to create animated basketball plays using an intuitive interface and AI-assisted enhancements. The application is designed to be lightweight, requiring no server-side processing for core functionality.

## System Architecture

### Client-Side Architecture

The application follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:

## Core Components

### 1. User Interface Module

Responsible for rendering the UI components and handling user interactions.

- **Court Designer**: Renders the basketball court
- **Player Manager**: Handles player marker placement and customization
- **Path Editor**: Manages creation and editing of movement paths
- **Animation Controls**: Play, pause, rewind, and speed controls
- **Library Interface**: UI for saving, loading, and organizing plays

### 2. Animation Engine

Core component that handles the animation logic and rendering.

- **Timeline Manager**: Controls the animation timeline and synchronization
- **Path Interpolation**: Calculates smooth transitions between keyframes
- **Rendering Layer**: Draws the animated elements on the canvas
- **Event System**: Triggers appropriate events during animation

### 3. AI Enhancement Module

Provides AI-powered features to improve animations and assist users.

- **Path Optimization**: Adjusts player movement paths to be more realistic
- **Speed Adjustment**: Intelligently modifies player speeds based on context
- **Natural Language Processor**: Interprets user text prompts
- **Play Suggestion Engine**: Recommends improvements or variations

### 4. Storage Module

Handles data persistence and management.

- **Play Library**: Stores and organizes saved plays
- **Export Module**: Converts animations to shareable formats
- **Import Module**: Handles importing plays from external sources
- **Data Versioning**: Ensures compatibility between different versions

## Data Flow

1. **Play Creation**:
   - User places players on court
   - User draws movement paths
   - User adds ball movement
   - User configures timing and details

2. **AI Enhancement**:
   - User enters text description
   - AI processes the description
   - AI suggests adjustments to movements
   - User accepts or modifies suggestions

3. **Animation**:
   - Animation engine calculates all positions at each time step
   - Rendering layer draws each frame
   - UI updates to reflect current state

4. **Storage/Sharing**:
   - Play is serialized to JSON format
   - Stored in local storage or exported
   - Can be loaded, modified, or shared

## Technology Choices

### Frontend Framework: Vue.js

Vue.js was chosen for its:
- Lightweight footprint
- Component-based architecture
- Reactive data binding
- Smooth learning curve

### Animation: Canvas API

The HTML5 Canvas API was selected because:
- High performance for real-time animations
- Direct pixel manipulation
- Broad browser support
- No dependencies required

### AI Processing: TensorFlow.js

TensorFlow.js enables:
- Client-side machine learning
- Path optimization algorithms
- No server dependence for basic AI features
- Progressive enhancement (falls back gracefully)

### Storage: IndexedDB / Local Storage

Client-side storage solutions provide:
- Offline capability
- No backend required for core functionality
- Sufficient capacity for storing play libraries

## Performance Considerations

- **Animation Optimization**: Using requestAnimationFrame for smooth animations
- **Lazy Loading**: Components loaded only when needed
- **Memory Management**: Proper cleanup of unused resources
- **Canvas Optimization**: Limiting redraws to changed areas when possible

## Security Considerations

- **Data Privacy**: All data stored locally by default
- **Content Security Policy**: Strict CSP to prevent XSS
- **Input Validation**: Thorough validation of all user inputs
- **Third-Party Dependencies**: Limited use and regular security audits

## Extensibility

The architecture is designed to be extensible for future features:

- **Server Integration**: Optional server backend for team sharing and advanced features
- **Plugin System**: Ability to add new play types or court layouts
- **API Layer**: Well-defined interfaces for adding new components
- **Analytics**: Framework for adding usage analytics

## Technical Debt and Limitations

- Initial version has limited animation complexity
- AI features require browser support for WebGL
- Mobile performance may vary on older devices
- No real-time collaboration in the initial version

## Future Architectural Considerations

- **WebAssembly**: For more complex physics calculations
- **WebRTC**: For real-time collaboration features
- **Server-Side AI**: For more advanced AI features beyond client capabilities
- **3D Rendering**: Potential for 3D view options using WebGL
